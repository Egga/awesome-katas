## How to Play

* Work in pairs (should be a given anyway)
* Person A only writes tests
* Person B tries to get the tests to pass with absolute minimalist code (that doesn't need to actually implement the specification)
* Both refactor when appropriate

The goal is to practice writing tests that drive the implementation into a certain direction.
