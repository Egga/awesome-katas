## Rules

* No return values
* No side effects changing "global variables"
* Don't use exceptions as return values

Yeah, really... That's the whole show. If you try this for the first
time it might seem impossible or not very useful. Trust us, you will

In some languages you will need a mocking framework to write proper
test.

Believe us: you can do it!
