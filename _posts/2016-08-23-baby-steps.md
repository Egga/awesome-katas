1. Setup source control repository.
2. Setup a timer for 2 minutes interval when you start.
3. Write exactly one test
   * If the timer rings and the test is red then revert and start over.
   * If the test is green before timer rings then commit.
4. Restart timer (no discussions in between timers)
5. Refactor
   * If the timer rings and the refactoring is not complete then revert and start over.
   * If the refactoring is complete before the timer rings then commit.
6. Restart the timer (no discussions in between timers)
7. Go to 3.
8. When session time is up delete the code.
