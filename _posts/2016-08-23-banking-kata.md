## Your Task
Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software and they hired both of you for a greenfield project in - what a happy coincidence - your favorite programming language!

Your task is to show them that your TDD-fu and your new-age programming language can cope with good oleâ€™ COBOL! 

## Requirements
An Account should have means to process a Deposit and Withdrawal
Print an ASCII Account statement (date, transaction amount, balance after transaction)
